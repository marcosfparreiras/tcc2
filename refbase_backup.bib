abstract = {The present study addresses the issues concerning the developpment of a reliable assisted remote control for a four-rotor miniature aerial robot (known as quadrotor), guaranteeing the capability of a stable autonomous flight. The following results are proposed: after establishing a dynamical flight model as well as models for the rotors, gears and motors of the quadrotor, different nonlinear control laws are investigated for attitude and posi- tion control of the UAV. The stability and performance of feedback, backstepping and sliding mode controllers are compared in simulations. Finally, experiments on a newly implemented quadrotor prototype have been conducted in order to validate the theoretical analysis.},

@book{Kasabov1998,
abstract = {We are surprisingly flexible in processing information in the real world. The human brain, consisting of 1011 neurons, realizes intelligent information processing based on exact and commonsense reasoning. Scientists have been trying to implement human intelligence in computers in various ways. Artificial intelligence (AI) pursues exact logical reasoning based on symbol manipulation. Fuzzy engineering uses analog values to realize fuzzy but robust and efficient reasoning. They are macroscopic ways to realize human intelligence at the level of symbols and rules. Neural networks are a microscopic approach to the intelligence of the brain in which information is represented by excitation patterns of neurons. All of these approaches are partially successful in implementing human intelligence, but are still far from the real one. AI uses mathematically rigorous logical reasoning but is not flexible and is difficult to implement. Fuzzy systems provide convenient and flexible methods of reasoning at the sacrifice of depth and exactness. Neural networks use learning and self-organizing ability but are difficult for handling symbolic reasoning. The point is how to design computerized reasoning, taking account of these methods. This book solves this problem by combining the three techniques to minimize their weaknesses and enhance their strong points. The book begins with an excellent introduction to AI, fuzzy-, and neuroengineering. The author succeeds in explaining the fundamental ideas and practical methods of these techniques by using many familiar examples. The reason for his success is that the book takes a problem-driven approach by presenting problems to be solved and then showing ideas of how to solve them, rather than by following the traditional theorem-proof style. The book provides an understandable approach to knowledge-based systems for problem solving by combining different methods of AI, fuzzy systems, and neural networks.},

abstract = {An interactive procedure is presented for controller design of
nonlinear systems by integrating available classical as well as modem
tools such as fuzzy logic, and neural networks. The proposed approach is
based on quasi-linear dynamic models of the plant. Classical optimal
controllers for each set of operating conditions were developed. These
controllers are used to construct a single fuzzy-logic gain
scheduling-like controller. Adaptive-neuro-fuzzy inference system was
used to construct the rules for the fuzzy gain schedule. This will
guarantee the continuous change in the gains as the system parameters
change in time or space. The proposed approach is applied on a well
known bench mark system, the inverted pendulum},

@article{Al-Younes2008,
abstract = {Inspired by advantages of backstepping control theory combined with rule-based control technique and with least-mean-square algorithm, this paper introduces the Backstepping Fuzzy Logic controller (BFL) and Backstepping Least Mean Square controller (BLMS) as new approaches to control the attitude stabilization of quadrotor UAV. In this paper a recursive Lyapunov function is introduced to ensure the stability around a fixed set-point using backstepping control algorithm. The BFL controller utilizes the advantage of fuzzy logic to schedule the backstepping controller parameters. This resulted in improved performance compeered with that achieved by backstepping controller alone. On the other hand, the BLMS controller is used to minimize the control efforts by finding the parameters of backstepping controller which provide minimum control efforts to the system. Finally, a comparison between Backstepping, BFL and BLMS controllers are presented. BLMS controller suffered from a slow time response while having reduced control effort when compared with the BFL controller. Combined performance of the BFL controller was superior to the backstepping or BLMS controller.},

abstract = {In this work we present an optimized fuzzy visual servoing system for obstacle avoidance using an unmanned aerial vehicle. The cross-entropy theory is used to optimise the gains of our controllers. The optimization process was made using the ROS-Gazebo 3D simulation with purposeful extensions developed for our experiments. Visual servoing is achieved through an image processing front-end that uses the Camshift algorithm to detect and track objects in the scene. Experimental flight trials using a small quadrotor were performed to validate the parameters estimated from simulation. The integration of cross- entropy methods is a straightforward way to estimate optimal gains achieving excellent results when tested in real flights},

@article{Senkul2013,
abstract = {The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for military, scientific, and civilian sectors are increasing drastically in recent years. The quadrotor platform has been used for many applications and research studies, as well. One of the limiting factors that prevents further implementation of the quadrotor system into applications, is the way quadrotor moves. It needs to tilt along the desired direction of motion. By doing this it can have necessary acceleration towards that direction. But tilting has the undesired effect of moving the onboard cameras' direction of view. This becomes an issue for surveillance and other vision based tasks. This study presents the design and control of a novel quadrotor system. Unlike previous study that uses regular quadrotor, this study proposes an alternative propulsion system formed by tilting rotors. This design eliminates the need of tilting the airframe, and it suggests superior performance with respect to regular quadrotor design. The mathematical model of the tiltable-rotor type quadrotor and designed control algorithms are explained. Various simulations are developed on MATLAB, in which the proposed quadrotor aerial vehicle has been successfully controlled. Comparison of the proposed system to regular quadrotor suggests better performance. © 2013 IEEE.},

@article{JavidiNiroumand2013,
abstract = {In this paper we present a hybrid control method for a vertical flight four-rotor helicopter, named quadrotor. Quadrotor helicopter is a nonlinear dynamical system which is inherently unstable, thus the stabilization and hovering is critically challenging. Conventional control approaches use linear control theory that is suitable for linear systems only. In this approach, first we derive a nonlinear dynamic model of quadrotor, and then we performed a mixed controller using classical and intelligent control methods for stabilizing rotational dynamics. Integral Backstepping (IBS) is a reinforced nonlinear widely used control law, for such a system, but finding the appropriate coefficient of this algorithm is a critical job. The problem has been solved with fuzzy control method. Fuzzy as an intelligent control method is a powerful technique and has been presented to realize robust attitude control for a quadrotor. This study showed that although, both of the classical IBS and the Fuzzy IBS controllers can control the system properly, the Fuzzy IBS controllers performed slightly better than the classical IBS controllers, and have benefits such as better disturbance rejection and more robustness.},
