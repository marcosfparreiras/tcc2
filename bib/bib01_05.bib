@article{Alata2001,
abstract = {An interactive procedure is presented for controller design of
nonlinear systems by integrating available classical as well as modem
tools such as fuzzy logic, and neural networks. The proposed approach is
based on quasi-linear dynamic models of the plant. Classical optimal
controllers for each set of operating conditions were developed. These
controllers are used to construct a single fuzzy-logic gain
scheduling-like controller. Adaptive-neuro-fuzzy inference system was
used to construct the rules for the fuzzy gain schedule. This will
guarantee the continuous change in the gains as the system parameters
change in time or space. The proposed approach is applied on a well
known bench mark system, the inverted pendulum},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), based on a neuro-fuzzy controller, as a possible control mechanism for a ship stabilizing fin system. Simulation results show that ANFIS can effectively improve the ship stabilizing performance against roll motion in cases of rough sea conditions. it is a promising alternative to conventional PID controllers.},
