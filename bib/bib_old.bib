abstract = {The present study addresses the issues concerning the developpment of a reliable assisted remote control for a four-rotor miniature aerial robot (known as quadrotor), guaranteeing the capability of a stable autonomous flight. The following results are proposed: after establishing a dynamical flight model as well as models for the rotors, gears and motors of the quadrotor, different nonlinear control laws are investigated for attitude and posi- tion control of the UAV. The stability and performance of feedback, backstepping and sliding mode controllers are compared in simulations. Finally, experiments on a newly implemented quadrotor prototype have been conducted in order to validate the theoretical analysis.},

abstract = { Progresses in sensor technology, data processing and integrated actuators has made the development of miniature flying robots fully possible. Micro VTOL systems represent a useful class of flying robots because of their strong capabilities for small-area monitoring and building exploration. In this paper we describe the approach that our lab has taken to micro VTOL evolving towards full autonomy, and present the mechanical design, dynamic modelling, sensing, and control of our indoor VTOL autonomous robot OS4.},
