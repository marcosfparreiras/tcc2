abstract = {A new method for adaptive-fuzzy control achieves stabilization of a quadrotor helicopter in the presence of sinusoidal wind disturbance. Techniques traditionally used in adaptive control for robust parameter updates may not be sufficient for fuzzy schemes. In particular, e-modification may result in the fuzzy-membership centers drifting to large values when persistent oscillations are present in the input. These large values can cause control signal chatter, which can be undesirable or even cause instability if they excite unmodeled dynamics. A new method for robust updates is proposed that prevents this drift in the fuzzy membership centers. In the new method, a set of alternate membership function centers guides the adaptation process in order to prevent drift. A Lyapunov-stability proof ensures the uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals. A simulation of a quadrotor helicopter demonstrates the high performance and robust stability of the new method},

@article{Al-Younes2008,
abstract = {Inspired by advantages of backstepping control theory combined with rule-based control technique and with least-mean-square algorithm, this paper introduces the Backstepping Fuzzy Logic controller (BFL) and Backstepping Least Mean Square controller (BLMS) as new approaches to control the attitude stabilization of quadrotor UAV. In this paper a recursive Lyapunov function is introduced to ensure the stability around a fixed set-point using backstepping control algorithm. The BFL controller utilizes the advantage of fuzzy logic to schedule the backstepping controller parameters. This resulted in improved performance compeered with that achieved by backstepping controller alone. On the other hand, the BLMS controller is used to minimize the control efforts by finding the parameters of backstepping controller which provide minimum control efforts to the system. Finally, a comparison between Backstepping, BFL and BLMS controllers are presented. BLMS controller suffered from a slow time response while having reduced control effort when compared with the BFL controller. Combined performance of the BFL controller was superior to the backstepping or BLMS controller.},

@article{Mehra2010,
abstract = {This study deals with the control of chaos using Generalized Backstepping Method. This new method to control nonlinear systems was called generalized backstepping method because of its similarity to backstepping but its abilities to control systems more than it and could achieve better performance in respect of lower signal control,short settling time and overshoot,control ability of MIMO systems and non strict feedback systems. The generalized backstepping approach consists of parameters which accept positive values.The parameters are usually chosen optional.The system responded differently for each value. This paper introduces novel adaptive neuro fuzzy control method which trained by different error data and learns online to achieve optimal parameters.},
